aria-labelledby="subject-areas"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Subject Areas</h1><p>We invite submissions relevant to the following broad areas of interest, all connected with parsimony and learning in modern data science:</p><ul><li>Models and Algorithms<li>Data<li>Theory<li>Hardware and Systems<li>Applications and Science</ul><p>Please reference the detailed listing <a href="/subject_areas">here</a>.</p><h1 id="submission-tracks-and-review-process"> <a href="#submission-tracks-and-review-process"

Process</h1><p>We will have a main proceeding track (archival), and a “recent spotlight” track (non-archival).</p><h2 id="proceeding-track--archival"> <a href="#proceeding-track--archival" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="proceeding-track--archival"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Proceeding Track (archival)</h2><p>The submission and review stage will be <strong>double-blind</strong>. We use OpenReview to host papers and allow for public discussions. Before the end of the Authors-Reviewers Discussion Stage, besides official reviews, anyone can post publicly visible comments; and authors can participate in the discussion as well as update their submission at any time. After that, there will be an internal discussion period amongst reviewers and ACs with the aim of summarizing the review process, after which the final decisions are made by ACs.</p><p>After the notification deadline, accepted and opted-in rejected papers will be made public and open for non-anonymous public commenting. Their anonymous reviews, meta-reviews, author responses and reviewer responses will also be made public. Authors of rejected papers will have two weeks after the notification deadline to opt in to make their de-anonymized rejected papers public in OpenReview.</p><p>Submissions that are substantially similar to papers previously published, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed venues with proceedings or journals may not be submitted to the Proceeding Track. Papers previously presented at workshops are permitted, so long as they did not appear in a conference proceedings (e.g., CVPRW proceedings), a journal or a book.</p><p>The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other online repositories, personal websites, social media) will not result in rejection. Authors may submit anonymized work to CPAL that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv) without citing it.</p><p>Accepted papers will be published in the <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/">Proceedings for Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</a>. Full proceedings papers can have up to 9 pages with unlimited pages for references and appendix. Upon acceptance of a paper, at least one of the authors must join the conference.</p><h3 id="using-large-language-models-llms"> <a href="#using-large-language-models-llms" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="using-large-language-models-llms"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Using Large Language Models (LLMs)</h3><p>We follow the rule by NeurIPS 2023, quoted as follows:</p><p class="quote"><em>“We welcome authors to use any tool that is suitable for preparing high-quality papers and research. However, we ask authors to keep in mind two important criteria. First, we expect papers to fully describe their methodology, and any tool that is important to that methodology, including the use of LLMs, should be described also. For example, authors should mention tools (including LLMs) that were used for data processing or filtering, visualization, facilitating or running experiments, and proving theorems. It may also be advisable to describe the use of LLMs in implementing the method (if this corresponds to an important, original, or non-standard component of the approach). Second, authors are responsible for the entire content of the paper, including all text and figures, so while authors are welcome to use any tool they wish for writing the paper, they must ensure that all text is correct and original.”</em></p><h2 id="recent-spotlight-track-non-archival"> <a href="#recent-spotlight-track-non-archival" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="recent-spotlight-track-non-archival"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> “Recent Spotlight” Track (non-archival)</h2><p>We meanwhile aim to showcase the latest research innovations at all stages of the research process, from work-in-progress to recently published papers. Concretely, we ask members of the community to submit a conference-style paper (from four to eight pages, with extra pages for references) describing the work. Please also upload a short (250 word) abstract to OpenReview. OpenReview submissions may also include any of the following supplemental materials that describe the work in further detail:</p><ul><li><strong>A poster</strong> (in PDF form) presenting results of work-in-progress.<li><strong>A link to an arXiv preprint or a blog post</strong> (e.g., distill.pub, Medium) describing results.<li><strong>Appendices</strong> with detailed derivations and additional experiments.</ul><p>This track is non-archival and has no proceedings. We permit under-review or concurrent submissions. Reviewing will be performed in a single-blind fashion (authors should not anonymize their submissions), and will be held with the same high quality bar with the Proceeding Track.</p><h1 id="reviewer-guidelines"> <a href="#reviewer-guidelines" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="reviewer-guidelines"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Reviewer Guidelines</h1><h2 id="notable-innovations-in-our-review-mechanism"> <a href="#notable-innovations-in-our-review-mechanism" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="notable-innovations-in-our-review-mechanism"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Notable Innovations in Our Review Mechanism</h2><p>CPAL strives for providing every paper with high-quality, accountable reviews, and therefore takes the following actions in addition:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Shepherding by an Action PC:</em></strong> Every paper’s final decision, after being recommended by AC, will go through the direct shepherding of all program chairs (led by one “action PC”). The action PC has two main duties:<ul><li>(before final decision released) The action PC will pay particular attention to the borderline cases and the dispute (large score variations) cases, and will be asked to write additional “meta-meta reviews” in those cases and potentially calibrate on top of AC recommendations. Final decisions will be scrutinized and made in a joint meeting by all program chairs.<li>(after receiving the camera-ready) Each accepted paper’s authors will be asked to submit a one-page cover letter, summarizing what revisions are made between the paper’s submitted and camera-ready versions. The action PC will ensure: (1) all “promised” changes by authors during the discussion stage are indeed implemented; (2) no change that is “too substantial” and “unsoliciated” shall be made to the paper, unless in exceptional circumstances where the action PC has to approve case-by-case. The action PC reserves the right to reject a camera-ready submission and exclude it from the conference proceedings.</ul><li><p><strong><em>Semi-Open Identity for Accountability (Action PC and/or AC)</em></strong>: For every <strong>accepted paper</strong>, the names of its AC and action PC will be publicly released on its OpenReview page too. For every rejected paper (excluding withdrawals), only the name of its action PC will be displayed. <strong>This decision was not reached lightly; but we hope it would meaningfully add credibility and accountability for every paper’s final outcome.</strong></p><li><strong><em>Reviewer Rating and “Dynamic Sparse Selection”:</em></strong> each AC will be asked to rate every reviewer in their batch, in terms of timeliness and quality. Program chairs, who know all reviewers’ identities, will compile a list of reviewers sorted by their average ratings received. Reviewers that receive consistent low reviewer rating for multiple papers / from multiple ACs will be excluded from future review processes.</ul><h2 id="general-guidelines"> <a href="#general-guidelines" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="general-guidelines"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> General Guidelines</h2><p>We all like the Acceptance Criteria made by TMLR <a href="https://jmlr.org/tmlr/acceptance-criteria.html">https://jmlr.org/tmlr/acceptance-criteria.html</a> and would instruct our ACs and reviewers to honor the same. In particular we note:</p><p class="quote"><em>“Crucially, it should not be used as a reason to reject work that isn’t considered “significant” or “impactful” because it isn’t achieving a new state-of-the-art on some benchmark. Nor should it form the basis for rejecting work on a method considered not “novel enough”, as novelty of the studied method is not a necessary criteria for acceptance. We explicitly avoid these terms (“significant”, “impactful”, “novel”), and focus instead on the notion of “interest”. If the authors make it clear that there is something to be learned by some researchers in their area from their work, then the criteria of interest is considered satisfied.</em></p><h1 id="code-of-conduct"> <a href="#code-of-conduct" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="code-of-conduct"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Code of Conduct</h1><p><em>(Adapted from ICML/ICLR/NeurIPS/LoG)</em></p><p>We strive to hold a conference in which any person can meaningfully participate in the LoG community through: sharing ideas, presenting their work, meeting members of the community, learning from other people’s work, and discussing ways to improve the community.</p><p>This conference will work towards preventing any type of discrimination based on age, disability, ethnicity, experience in the field, gender identity, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics. We strictly prohibit any actions that may prevent the participation of any attendee, including: bullying, harassment, inappropriate media, offensive language, violence, zoom bombing, and so on.</p><p>Please report any violations of the code of conduct to the conference organizers, via email, slack, or any other channels. If requested, we can handle these reports anonymously, to protect the person making the report. Violators of the code of conduct will be asked to stop their inappropriate behavior, and may be removed from their right to participate in the conference. Further disciplinary action such as bans from future iterations of the conference may be taken.</p><hr><h2 class="text-delta">Table of contents</h2><ul><li> <a href="/subject_areas/">Subject Areas</a></ul></div></div></div>
