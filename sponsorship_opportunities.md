# CPAL 2025 Sponsorship Opportunities

The 2nd Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL), chaired by Professors
Emmanuel Candès and Yi Ma, will take place at Stanford University from
March 24–27, 2025.

CPAL grew from the [SlowDNN workshop](https://slowdnn-workshop.github.io), which ran successfully for three years
(2021-2023) and evolved into the inaugural CPAL 2024 held in Hong Kong. CPAL
2024 brought together over 200 elite researchers specializing in sparsity and
efficient AI for four days of in-depth, in-person interactions. The conference
also attracted significant sponsorship support from both international and local
partners: [https://2024.cpal.cc/sponsors/](https://2024.cpal.cc/sponsors/)

CPAL 2025 aims to foster collaboration and share cutting-edge
research in sparse and low-dimensional structure modeling in deep learning,
bridging theory, algorithms, and practical applications. We expect experts from
machine learning, applied mathematics, signal processing, optimization, systems,
and natural sciences like physics and neuroscience to join us. Located on
Stanford's campus in the heart of Silicon Valley, CPAL 2025 is poised to attract
a high-caliber audience and create broader, more impactful connections.

Given this exciting opportunity, we invite interested parties to help sponsor
CPAL 2025. We believe this presents a valuable opportunity to engage with
leading minds in these fields. Additionally, sponsoring CPAL offers various
opportunities to connect with conference participants and showcase leadership in
advancing AI research.
