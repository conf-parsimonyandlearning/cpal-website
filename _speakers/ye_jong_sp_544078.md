talk: Scaling Diffusion Model for Inverse Problems Beyond 2D and Known Forward Models
abstract: Diffusion models have become a popular approach for image generation and reconstruction due to their numerous advantages. However, most diffusion-based inverse problem-solving methods only deal with 2D images, and even recently published 3D methods do not fully exploit the 3D distribution prior. Moreover, most of the approaches assume the known forward model, while many inverse problems are involved with blind reconstruction without prior knowledge of the forward model. To address this, we propose a novel approach using two perpendicular pre-trained 2D diffusion models to solve the 3D inverse problem, and blind diffusion models. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method is highly effective for MRI Z-axis super-resolution, compressed sensing MRI, and sparse-view CT, blind deconvolution.
