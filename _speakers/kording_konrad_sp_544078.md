talk: "How Can We Succeed With Parsimonious Models in a World that is Not So Parsimonious"
abstract: "Many interesting parts of the world, such as ecosystems, economies, psychology, cells and brains are, deep down, very much not explainable in a parsimonious way. And yet, humans, quite successfully, describe the world around them as it it were, and machine learning models are apparently internally quite parsimonious. I will comment on the statistical nature of the world around us and why we may succeed well assuming parsimony."
