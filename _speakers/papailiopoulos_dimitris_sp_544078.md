talk: "Teaching arithmetic to small language models"
abstract: "Can a language model truly “understand” arithmetic? We explore this by trying to teach small transformers from scratch to perform elementary arithmetic operations, using the next-token prediction objective. We first demonstrate that conventional training data (i.e., “A+B=C”) is not effective for arithmetic learning, and simple formatting changes can significantly improve accuracy. This leads to sharp phase transitions which, in some cases, can be explained through connections to low-rank matrix completion. We then train these small models on chain-of-thought data that includes intermediate steps. Even in the complete absence of pretraining, this approach significantly and simultaneously improves accuracy, sample complexity, and convergence speed. We finally discuss the issue of length generalization: can a model trained on n digits add n+1 digit numbers? Humans don’t need to be taught every digit length of addition to be able to perform it. It turns out that language models aren’t great at length generalization, but we catch glimpses of it in “unstable” scenarios. Surprisingly, the infamous U-shaped overfitting curve makes an appearance!"
bio: "Dimitris Papailiopoulos is the Jay & Cynthia Ihlenfeld Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research interests span machine learning, information theory, and distributed systems, with a current focus on understanding the intricacies of large-language models. Before coming to Madison, Dimitris was a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley and a member of the AMPLab. He earned his Ph.D. in ECE from UT Austin, under the supervision of Alex Dimakis. He received his ECE Diploma M.Sc. degree from the Technical University of Crete, in Greece. Dimitris is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2019), three years of Sony Faculty Innovation Awards (2018, 2019 and 2020), a joint IEEE ComSoc/ITSoc Best Paper Award (2020), an IEEE Signal Processing Society, Young Author Best Paper Award (2015), the Vilas Associate Award (2021), the Emil Steiger Distinguished Teaching Award (2021), and the Benjamin Smith Reynolds Award for Excellence in Teaching (2019). In 2018, he co-founded MLSys, a new conference that targets research at the intersection of machine learning and systems."
