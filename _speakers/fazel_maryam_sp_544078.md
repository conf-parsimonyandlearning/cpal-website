talk: "Flat Minima and Generalization in Learning: The Case of Low-rank Matrix Recovery"
abstract: "Many behaviors observed in deep neural networks still lack satisfactory explanation; e.g., how does an overparameterized neural network avoid overfitting and generalize to unseen data? Empirical evidence suggests that generalization depends on which zero-loss local minimum is attained during training. The shape of the training loss around a local minimum affects the model’s performance: “Flat” minima---around which the loss grows slowly—appear to generalize well. Clarifying this phenomenon helps explain generalization properties, which still largely remain a mystery.<br> In this talk we focus on a simple class of overparameterized nonlinear models, those arising in low-rank matrix recovery. We study several key models: matrix sensing, phase retrieval, robust Principal Component Analysis, covariance matrix estimation, and single hidden layer neural networks with quadratic activation. We prove that in these models, flat minima (measured by average curvature) exactly recover the ground truth under standard statistical assumptions, and we prove weak recovery for matrix completion. These results suggest (i) a theoretical basis for favoring methods that bias iterates towards flat solutions, (ii) use of Hessian trace as a good regularizer. Since the landscape properties we prove are algorithm-agnostic, a future direction is to pair these findings with the analysis of common training algorithms to better understand the interplay between the loss landscape and algorithmic implicit bias."
