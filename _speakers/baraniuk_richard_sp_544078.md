talk: "Parsimony in the Geometry of Deep Learning"
abstract: "We study the geometry of deep learning through the lens of approximation theory via splines. The enabling insight is that a large class of deep networks can be written as a composition of continuous piecewise affine spline operators, which provides a powerful portal through which to interpret and analyze their inner workings. Our particular focus is the local geometry of the spline partition of the networkâ€™s input space, which opens up new avenues to study how deep networks parsimoniously organize signals in a hierarchical, multiscale fashion."
