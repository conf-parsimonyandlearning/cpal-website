abstract: "Computer scientists have always built languages and libraries to make it easier to write software for different domains. In the last decade, the demand for performance has dramatically increased due to more expensive uses of more data in machine learning. To deliver this performance, we are increasingly turning to specialized hardware. Such hardware places a large burden on the software stack and increases the need for compilers and programming models to be portable. I will share my thoughts on designing programming systems for machine learning applications that permit portable compilation across disparate hardware. These programming systems must raise the level of abstraction to diverse operations on four abstract collections: tensors, graphs, relations, and space. By raising the level of abstraction and by introducing new compiler techniques, we can make programs portable across different machines and different data structures. To manage complexity, compilers should target hardware-facing abstract machines that separate the software and hardware implementations. Finally, intermediate languages can also help us describe hardware to the compiler, so that we can target it without rewriting large parts of the compiler."
