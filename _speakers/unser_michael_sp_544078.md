talk: "Are the Methods of Convex Analysis Competitive with Deep Neural Networks?"
abstract: "Computational imaging is currently dominated by two paradigms. Traditional variational methods, supported by well-established theory, provide guarantees for convergence, stability, and signal recovery from limited measurements, as in compressed sensing. In contrast, deep neural network methods generally achieve superior image reconstruction but suffer from a lack of robustness (tendency to hallucinate) and theoretical understanding. This raises a fundamental question: Can variational methods be improved by learning the regularizer while maintaining their theoretical guarantees? To address this, we introduce a general framework for image reconstruction under the constraints of amplitude-equivariance and convexity. We demonstrate that polyhedral norms enable universality, allowing for the design of trainable regularization architectures. These architectures outperform traditional sparsity-based methods, and help us bridge the gap between theoretical rigor and practical performance in computational imaging."
bio: "Michael Unser is Full Professor at the EPFL and the academic director of EPFL's Center for Imaging, Lausanne, Switzerland. His primary areas of investigation are biomedical imaging and applied functional analysis. He is internationally recognized for his research contributions to sampling theory, wavelets, the use of splines for image processing, and computational bioimaging. He has published over 400 journal papers on those topics. Prof. Unser is a fellow of the IEEE (1999), an EURASIP fellow (2009), and a member of the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences. He is the recipient of several international prizes including five IEEE-SPS Best Paper Awards, two Technical Achievement Awards from the IEEE (2008 SPS and EMBS 2010), the Technical Achievement Award from EURASIP (2018), and the IEEE-EMBS Career Achievement Award (2020). He was awarded three ERC AdG grants: FUNSP (2011-2016), GlobalBioIm (2016-2021), and FunLearn (2021-2026) in succession, with the ERC funding scheme being the most competitive one in Europe."
