talk: "On learning and imagination: of mice and machines"
abstract: "Three remarkable abilities of brains and machines are to: (1) learn behaviors from a single example, (2) imagine new possibilities, and (3) perform mathematical reasoning. I will discuss completely mechanistically interpretable and predictive models of how mice perform (1) during navigation, and how diffusion models imagine new images in (2). Then I will consider how LLM training protocols can be modified so that they can better perform mathematical reasoning in (3). Together this will cover a subset of how mice and machines learn, imagine and reason.<br><br>References:<br>Mouse navigation: <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08034-3'>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08034-3</a><br>Theory of creativity in diffusion models: <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20292'>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20292</a><br>Mathematical reasoning: <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07154'>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07154</a>"
