talk: "In-Context Convergence of Transformers"
abstract: "Transformers have recently revolutionized many machine learning domains and one salient discovery is their remarkable in-context learning capability, where models can capture an unseen task by utilizing task-specific prompts without further parameters fine-tuning. In this talk, I will present our recent work that aims at understanding the in-context learning mechanism of transformers. Our focus is on the learning dynamics of a one-layer transformer with softmax attention trained via gradient descent in order to in-context learn linear function classes. I will first present our characterization of the training convergence of in-context learning for data with balanced and imbalanced features, respectively. I will then discuss the insights that we obtain about attention models and training processes. I will also talk about the analysis techniques that we develop which may be useful for a broader set of problems. I will finally conclude my talk with comments on a few future directions.<br>This is a joint work with Yu Huang (UPenn) and Yuan Cheng (NUS)."
