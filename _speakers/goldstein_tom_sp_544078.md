talk: "Statistical methods for addressing safety and security issues of generative models"
abstract: "This talk will have two parts.  In the first part, I’ll talk about mathematical perspectives on how to watermark generative models to prevent parameter theft,  ways to watermark generative model outputs to enable detection, and ways to perform post-hoc detection of language models without relying on watermarks.  I’ll emphasize the important idea of using statistical hypothesis testing and p-values to provide rigorous control of the false-positive rate of detection. In the second part of the talk, I’ll present methods for constructing neural networks that exhibit “slow” thinking abilities akin to human logical reasoning.  Rather than learning simple pattern matching rules, these networks have the ability to synthesize algorithmic reasoning processes and solve difficult discrete search and planning problems that cannot be solved by conventional AI systems.  Interestingly, these reasoning systems naturally exhibit error correction and robustness properties that make them more difficult to break than their fast thinking counterparts."
