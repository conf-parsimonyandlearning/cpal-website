talk: "Representation and Control of Meanings in Large Language Models and Multimodal Foundation Models"
abstract: "Large Language Models and Multimodal Foundation Models, despite the simple predictive learning criterion and absence of explicit complexity bias, have shown the ability to capture the structure and “meaning” of data. I will introduce a notion of “meaning” for large language models as equivalence classes of sentences, and describe methods to establish a geometry and topology in the space of meanings, as well as an algebra so meanings can be composed and asymmetric relations such as entailment and implication can be quantified. Meanings as equivalence classes of sentences determined by the trained embedings can be defined, computed and quantified for pre-trained models, without the need for instruction tuning, reinforcement learning, or prompt engineering. Meanings as trajectories can be shown to align with human assessment through manually annotated benchmarks and can, as the outputs of dynamical systems, be controlled. I will show illustrative examples using both text and imaging modalities."
bio: "Professor Soatto received his Ph.D. in Control and Dynamical Systems from the California Institute of Technology in 1996; he joined UCLA in 2000 after being Assistant and then Associate Professor of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering at Washington University, and Research Associate in Applied Sciences at Harvard University. Between 1995 and 1998 he was also Ricercatore in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Udine - Italy. He received his D.Ing. degree (highest honors) from the University of Padova- Italy in 1992. His general research interests are in Computer Vision and Nonlinear Estimation and Control Theory. In particular, he is interested in ways for computers to use sensory information (e.g. vision, sound, touch) to interact with humans and the environment.  Dr. Soatto is the recipient of the David Marr Prize (with Y. Ma, J. Kosecka and S. Sastry of U.C. Berkeley) for work on Euclidean reconstruction and reprojection up to subgroups. He also received the Siemens Prize with the Outstanding Paper Award from the IEEE Computer Society for his work on optimal structure from motion (with R. Brockett of Harvard). He received the National Science Foundation Career Award and the Okawa Foundation Grant. He is Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) and a Member of the Editorial Board of the International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) and Foundations and Trends in Computer Graphics and Vision."
