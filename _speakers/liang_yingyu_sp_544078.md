talk: "Towards Better Understanding of Deep Learning via Investigations of the Learning Dynamics"
abstract: "Compared to the unprecedented empirical success of deep learning, theoretical understanding largely lags behind. In particular, traditional tools are inadequate for analyzing the optimization and generalization in deep learning. This talk will discuss the unique and novel challenges in this direction, via a few case studies: the neural tangent kernel (NTK) approach, feature learning beyond NTK, and different in-context learning behavior of larger language models."
