The Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL) is an annual research
conference focused on addressing the parsimonious, low dimensional structures
that prevail in machine learning, signal processing, optimization, and beyond.
We are interested in theories, algorithms, applications, hardware and systems,
as well as scientific foundations for learning with parsimony. 

We describe [our]({{ site.baseurl }}/organizers) vision for the conference in
more detail [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/vision).
