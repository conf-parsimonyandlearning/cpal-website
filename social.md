# Social and Networking Events at CPAL

CPAL and HKU have prepared social and networking events for conference
attendees to enjoy. In addition to a reception on Day 1 of the conference,
larger events (with advance registration required), described on this page,
will take place.

The scheduling of events can be found in the schedule view of the
[conference program]({{ site.baseurl }}/program_schedule/), colored in gold.

## Dinner Banquet (January 4th, 2024)

Enjoy a tasteful meal during which traditional Chinese dishes will be served. The delightful
evening will be highlighted by the ***award presentations for Best Paper Winners and Rising
Star Award recipients***. We have prepared round-trip shuttle bus services to take you from
the CPAL venue to the dinner restaurant, should you need so. The restaurant is
conveniently located in Central, a CBD area in Hong Kong, so you could also choose to
explore the city after the meal.
