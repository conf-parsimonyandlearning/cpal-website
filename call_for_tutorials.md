# Call for Tutorials

The CPAL 2026 Organizing Committee invites proposals for in-person tutorials on advancing our understanding of intelligence through the lens of parsimonious learning and its various facets. We welcome tutorials on a wide range of topics, including

* Theories of parsimonious learning
* Algorithms and implementations
* Applications in various domains
* Hardware and systems for efficient learning
* Scientific foundations and connections to other fields

Tutorials should be broadly appealing to the CPAL community and are expected to be accessible to PhD candidates working in the areas of machine learning and intelligence in general. Tutorials should represent a sufficiently mature area of research or practice and should provide a balanced and accessible overview. We encourage proposals with speakers from different institutions to reduce knowledge bias.

**Submission Guidelines:**

Tutorial proposals should be submitted via [this form](https://forms.gle/2enjscpiDJi1NAkC8) before the deadline indicated on [https://cpal.cc/](https://cpal.cc/). Your proposal should answer the following questions:

* Title
* Abstract: A summary of the tutorial content (up to 250 words).
* Outline: A detailed outline of the topics covered, including references and estimated time allocation.
* Target audience:  A description of the intended audience and their expected background.
* Presenters: For each presenter, include their name, affiliation, email address, and a short bio. Please discuss how time is split between the presenters. All presenters are required to attend in person.

**Selection Criteria:**

Tutorials will be selected based on:

* Relevance to CPAL's theme of parsimonious learning
* Clarity and comprehensiveness of the proposal
* Potential impact on the audience
* Speaker experience and diversity

**Tutorial Format:**

Tutorials will be held entirely in-person and will be 120-180 minutes long. Each tutorial must have at least two presenters.

**Questions**

For other questions, please contact [us](mailto:haotong.qin@pbl.ee.ethz.ch) ([haotong.qin@pbl.ee.ethz.ch](mailto:haotong.qin@pbl.ee.ethz.ch)).

We look forward to receiving your proposals!

The Organizing Committee, CPAL 2026
