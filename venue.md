# Logistics Information

We can't wait to welcome you **on Monday, March 24,** at the **CPAL 2025!** To help you make the most of the event, here are the key details you need to know:

## üóìÔ∏è Event Details

- **Date:** Monday, March 24th through Thursday, March 27th

- üïì **Time:** Varies by the day, but every day starts promptly at 9 am

  - 8:30 -- 9:00 AM: Registration, Monday (for Tutorials) and Tuesday (for the main Conference)

  - NOTE: Monday, March 24th -- is ONLY for those registered for the Tutorial Session. Badges will not be issued to anyone not registered for this day. We have not arranged catering for anyone not registered. Take this day to explore and enjoy the Stanford Campus!

  - [**Link to agenda**](https://cpal.cc/program_schedule/) (subject to change)

  - The Conference will provide light breakfast refreshments and coffee breaks with snacks morning and afternoon, but NOT lunch. We have arranged a delivery point with two of our most popular local eateries. They will take advance orders and deliver these each day to a location in the rear courtyard of the building. From there you can stay and enjoy the patio tables, find seating anywhere else in the building, or take a walk to enjoy your lunch elsewhere on campus. Using these will avoid the queues and wait times at any of the other campus locations:

    - Tootsies at the Stanford Barn -- select for 'pickup', set a day and time (Monday, 11:45 am, Tues-Thurs, 12:30 pm), and use the word CODA in the 'special instructions' area on the order form. The restaurant will know that the meal is for delivery by them to the rear courtyard of our building (weather permitting -- if not, they'll bring it inside).

    - Hummus Mediterranean Kitchen -- we are waiting for final instructions.
