# Reviewer Guidelines

## Notable Innovations in Our Review Mechanism

CPAL strives for providing every paper with high-quality, accountable reviews,
and therefore takes the following actions in addition:

- ***Shepherding by an Action PC:*** Every paper’s final decision, after being
  recommended by AC, will go through the direct shepherding of all program
  chairs (led by one “action PC”). The action PC has two main duties:
  - (before final decision released) The action PC will pay particular
  attention to the borderline cases and the dispute (large score variations)
  cases, and will be asked to write additional “meta-meta reviews” in those
  cases and potentially calibrate on top of AC recommendations.  Final
  decisions will be scrutinized and made in a joint meeting by all program
  chairs. 
  - (after receiving the camera-ready) Each accepted paper’s authors will be
  asked to submit a one-page cover letter, summarizing what revisions are made
  between the paper’s submitted and camera-ready versions. The action PC will
  ensure: (1) all “promised” changes by authors during the discussion stage are
  indeed implemented; (2) no change that is “too substantial” and
  “unsoliciated” shall be made to the paper, unless in exceptional
  circumstances where the action PC has to approve case-by-case. The action PC
  reserves the right to reject a camera-ready submission and exclude it from
  the conference proceedings.

- ***Semi-Open Identity for Accountability (Action PC and/or AC)***: For every
  **accepted paper**, the names of its AC and action PC will be publicly released
  on its OpenReview page too. For every rejected paper (excluding withdrawals),
  only the name of its action PC will be displayed. **This decision was not
  reached lightly; but we hope it would meaningfully add credibility and
  accountability for every paper’s final outcome.**

- ***Reviewer Rating and “Dynamic Sparse Selection”:*** each AC will be asked
  to rate every reviewer in their batch, in terms of timeliness and quality.
  Program chairs, who know all reviewers’ identities, will compile a list of
  reviewers sorted by their average ratings received. Reviewers that receive
  consistent low reviewer rating for multiple papers / from multiple ACs will
  be excluded from future review processes.

## General Guidelines

We all like the Acceptance Criteria made by TMLR
[https://jmlr.org/tmlr/acceptance-criteria.html](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/acceptance-criteria.html)
and would instruct our ACs and reviewers to honor the same. In particular we
note: 

*“Crucially, it should not be used as a reason to reject work that isn't
considered “significant” or “impactful” because it isn't achieving a new
state-of-the-art on some benchmark. Nor should it form the basis for rejecting
work on a method considered not “novel enough”, as novelty of the studied
method is not a necessary criteria for acceptance. We explicitly avoid these
terms (“significant”, “impactful”, “novel”), and focus instead on the notion of
“interest”. If the authors make it clear that there is something to be learned
by some researchers in their area from their work, then the criteria of
interest is considered satisfied.*
