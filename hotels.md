# Recommended Hotels

The CPAL 2025 local hosts, Stanford Data Science, have prepared a list of
recommended hotels near to the conference site for CPAL 2025 attendees.

The list below contains hotels near to Stanford that should offer a "Stanford
preferred rate". Please note that there is no guarantee that the listed hotels
will be able to honor the Stanford preferred rate when they are near full
capacity. Attendees are encouraged to book travel early.
