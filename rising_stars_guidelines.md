# CPAL Rising Stars Award

The Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL) launches the Rising Stars Award
program to highlight exceptional junior researchers at a critical inflection and
starting point in their career: last-year PhD students, postdoctoral scholars,
first-year tenure track faculty, or industry researcher within two years of
graduation.

CPAL is an annual research conference focused on addressing the parsimonious,
low dimensional structures that prevail in machine learning, signal processing,
optimization, and beyond. As in the last year, CPAL Rising Stars Award program
will provide PhD students, postdocs, junior faculties and industry researchers
the opportunity to plug into these networks, platforms, and opportunities. The
program also aims to increase representation and diversity in this area by
providing a platform and a supportive mentoring network to navigate academic
careers. All graduate students and postdocs, including those who belong to
groups underrepresented, are encouraged to apply, including but not limited to
people of all racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, sexual
orientations, genders, and persons with disabilities.
