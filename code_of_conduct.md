# Code of Conduct
*(Adapted from ICML/ICLR/NeurIPS/LoG)*

We strive to hold a conference in which any person can meaningfully participate
in the CPAL community through: sharing ideas, presenting their work, meeting
members of the community, learning from other peopleâ€™s work, and discussing
ways to improve the community. 

This conference will work towards preventing any type of discrimination based
on age, disability, ethnicity, experience in the field, gender identity,
nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, or other
protected characteristics. We strictly prohibit any actions that may prevent
the participation of any attendee, including: bullying, harassment,
inappropriate media, offensive language, violence, zoom bombing, and so on.

Please report any violations of the code of conduct to the conference
organizers, via email, slack, or any other channels. If requested, we can
handle these reports anonymously, to protect the person making the report.
Violators of the code of conduct will be asked to stop their inappropriate
behavior, and may be removed from their right to participate in the conference.
Further disciplinary action such as bans from future iterations of the
conference may be taken.
