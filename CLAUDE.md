# PR instructions
- When preparing a PR, always make your changes in a new feature branch. This
  will allow the changes to easily be built locally to verify the website works
  correctly.
- README.md in _db describes basic workflows for preparing and updating the
  website's raw data.
- The website should be built with `bundle exec jekyll build`.
