# Subject Areas


## Theory & Foundations
- Theories for sparse coding, structured sparsity, subspace learning,
  low-dimensional manifolds, and general low-dimensional structures. 
- Dictionary learning and representation learning for low-dimensional
  structures and their connections to deep learning theory.
- Equivariance and invariance modeling.
- Theoretical neuroscience and cognitive science foundation for parsimony, and
  biologically inspired computational mechanisms.

## Optimization & Algorithms
- Optimization, robustness, and generalization methods for learning compact and structured representations.
- Interpretable and efficient deep architectures (e.g., based on unrolled optimization).
- Data-efficient and computation-efficient training and inference.
- Adaptive and robust learning and inference algorithms.
- Other nonlinear dimension-reduction and representation-learning methods.

## Data & Applications
- Domain-specific datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. 
- Parsimonious and structured representation learning from data
- Inverse problems that benefit from parsimonious priors
- Applications in science, engineering, medicine, and social sciences.

## Integrated Intelligent Systems
- Autonomous agents or systems that integrate perception, learning, and decision making.
- Intelligent systems that co-design algorithms and hardware (i,e. robots).
- Distributed, networked, or federated learning systems for learning at scale.
