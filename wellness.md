# Tailored Wellness Sessions @ CPAL

On day 3 of the conference, as part of the conference program there will be
a tailored wellness session from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM.

The session will be led by Devin O'Rourke, a specialist in the field of
organizational development who focuses on tailoring mindfulness tools for
professionals. The sessions will be oriented specifically for supporting
researchers in computational disciplines.

We are offering this opportunity as a way to help ensure your experience at
CPAL is not only informative and engaging, but uplifting as well.
**All are welcome to attend!** No special clothing, equipment, etc. is required.

## Session Information

Inner Architecture explores the core ideas of mental health and mindfulness through the lens of
the principles that guide good computer science. The two arenas have much more in common than
we often consider. We will identify and harmonize some best practices and close with an experiential
wellness exercise incorporating the elements we discussed.
