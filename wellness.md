# Tailored Wellness Sessions @ CPAL

On days 2--4 of the conference (January 4th, Thursday, through January 6th,
Saturday), as part of the conference program there will be a morning tailored
wellness session from 8:00 AM to 8:40 AM.

Sessions will be led by Devin O'Rourke, a specialist in the field of
organizational development who focuses on tailoring mindfulness tools for
professionals. The sessions will be oriented specifically for supporting
researchers in computational disciplines.

We are offering this opportunity as a way to help ensure your experience at
CPAL is not only informative and engaging, but uplifting as well.
**All are welcome to attend!** No special clothing, equipment, etc. is required.
The sessions will transition effortlessly into the day's first talk.
