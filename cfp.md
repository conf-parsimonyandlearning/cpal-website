# Submission Tracks


CPAL has two submission tracks: a main proceeding track (archival), and a
“recent spotlight” track (non-archival). Please visit [this page]({{
site.baseurl }}/tracks) for full details of both tracks. 

Both tracks use
[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=CPAL.cc/2024) to manage
submissions and reviews. Submissions to both tracks are to be prepared using
the CPAL LaTeX style files, available as a [zip archive]({{
site.baseurl}}/assets/CPAL-2024-template.zip) or as an [Overleaf
template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/cpal-2024/kcdjgbnkzmpj).

# Reviewer Guidelines

CPAL implements several innovations in the reviewing process -- the most
notable is a semi-open identity of ACs and action PCs for accepted papers, as a
step towards improving review quality accountibility. 

Please consult [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/review_guidelines) for full
details.

# Code of Conduct
*(Adapted from ICML/ICLR/NeurIPS/LoG)*

We strive to hold a conference in which any person can meaningfully participate
in the CPAL community through: sharing ideas, presenting their work, meeting
members of the community, learning from other people’s work, and discussing
ways to improve the community. 

This conference will work towards preventing any type of discrimination based
on age, disability, ethnicity, experience in the field, gender identity,
nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, or other
protected characteristics. We strictly prohibit any actions that may prevent
the participation of any attendee, including: bullying, harassment,
inappropriate media, offensive language, violence, zoom bombing, and so on.

Please report any violations of the code of conduct to the conference
organizers, via email, slack, or any other channels. If requested, we can
handle these reports anonymously, to protect the person making the report.
Violators of the code of conduct will be asked to stop their inappropriate
behavior, and may be removed from their right to participate in the conference.
Further disciplinary action such as bans from future iterations of the
conference may be taken.
