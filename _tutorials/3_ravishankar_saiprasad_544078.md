tutorial: "Deep Learning for Imaging"
abstract: "Topics covered:<br>• Recap and introduction to deep learning methods for image reconstruction. Focus on physics-based deep learning methods.<br>• Unsupervised deep learning methods: plug and play (PnP) priors, consensus equilibrium, regularization by denoising.<br>• Supervised learning methods: deep unrolling, deep equilibrium methods, bilevel optimization methods.<br>• Generative models for image reconstruction: deep image prior, GANs, diffusion models.<br>• Other trends: deep reinforcement learning for imaging, unified deep learning and sparse modeling, ensuring robustness of deep learning based image reconstruction to various perturbations (e.g., via randomized smoothing, diffusion models, etc.), learning sparse neural networks, joint training of sensing and image reconstruction.<br>• Conclusions and future directions in the field."
