tutorial: "Understanding Deep Representation Learning via Neural Collapse"
abstract: "The session focuses on the strong conceptual connections between low-dimensional structures and deep models in terms of learned representation. We start with the introduction of an intriguing Neural Collapse phenomenon in the last-layer representation and its universality in deep network, and lays out the mathematical foundations of understanding its cause by studying its optimization landscapes. We then generalize and explain this phenomenon and its implications under data imbalanceness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical algorithmic implications of Neural Collapse on training deep neural networks."
