tutorial: "Sparse Modeling for Image Reconstruction"
abstract: "Data-driven and machine learning techniques have received increasing attention in recent years for solving various problems in computational imaging. First, we will introduce basics of image reconstruction and sparse modeling before discussing the learning of various classical sparse signal models, particularly synthesis dictionaries and sparsifying transforms. The application of dictionary and transform learning to primarily medical image reconstruction will be discussed. We will also briefly discuss the combination of sparsity with other priors (e.g., low-rank) and variants such as convolutional dictionary learning and multi-layer sparse models used in image reconstruction.<br><em>Time: 50 minutes</em>"
