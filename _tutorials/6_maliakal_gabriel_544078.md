abstract: "We will introduce modern deep learning-based methods for image reconstruction, particularly in medical imaging, including image-domain or sensor-domain neural network denoisers, and hybrid-domain deep learning schemes that combine physics-based forward models together with neural networks. Hybrid methods, both supervised and unsupervised or self-supervised, will be a key focus and amongst them, we will review plug and play (PnP) priors, consensus equilibrium, regularization by denoising (RED), deep unrolling methods, deep equilibrium models, and bilevel optimization based methods. Then, generative models for image reconstruction will be presented including generative adversarial networks (GANs), deep image prior, and diffusion models (DMs). We will provide a brief introduction to score-based DMs and introduce Diffusion Posterior Sampling ReSample algorithms. Other recent trends in image reconstruction will also be covered including exploiting deep reinforcement learning, unifying deep learning and sparse modeling, and methods focused on improving robustness of deep learning based image reconstruction (to various perturbations, train-test disparities, etc.) via randomized smoothing, diffusion models, etc. Other topics will also be covered briefly including learning sparse neural networks and joint or end-to-end training of sensing and image reconstruction setups. The session will conclude with brief discussion of future directions for the field.<br><br> Lecture 3 will involve multiple speakers covering different themes. Avrajit Ghosh will present many of the hybrid or physics-based deep learning methods. Dr. Ismail Alkhouri will speak on key ideas involving diffusion models. Gabriel Maliakal will discuss GANs and deep reinforcement learning and Dr. Saiprasad Ravishankar will speak on the key other topics.<br><br><em>Time: 140--150 minutes (coffee break in between)</em>"
