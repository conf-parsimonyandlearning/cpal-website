tutorial: "Invariant Low-Dimensional Subspaces in Gradient Descent for Learning Deep Networks"
abstract: "To conclude, we show that low-dimensional structures also emerge in training dynamics of deep networks. Specifically, we show that the evolution of gradient descent only affects a minimal portion of singular vector spaces across all weight matrices. The analysis enables us to considerably improve training efficiency by taking advantage of the low-dimensional structure in learning dynamics. We can construct smaller, equivalent deep linear networks without sacrificing the benefits associated with the wider counterparts. Moreover, it allows us to better understand deep representation learning by elucidating the progressive feature compression and discrimination from shallow to deep layers."
