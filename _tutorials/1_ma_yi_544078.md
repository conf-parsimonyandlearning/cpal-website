tutorial: "ReduNet: A White-box Deep Network from the Principle of Maximizing Rate Reduction"
abstract: "To begin, we will focus on the special yet highly useful case of learning the data distribution and transforming it to an <em>linear discriminative representation</em> (LDR). We will discuss the information theoretic and statistical principles behind such a representation, and design a loss function, called the <em>coding rate reduction</em>, which is optimized at such a representation. By unrolling the gradient ascent on the coding rate reduction, we will construct a deep network architecture, called the ReduNet, where each operator in the network has a mathematically precise (hence white-box and interpretable) function in the transformation of the data distribution towards an LDR. Also, the ReduNet may be constructed layer-wise in a forward-propagation manner, that is, without <em>any</em> back-propagation required."
