# Morning Yoga Sessions

On days 2--4 of the conference (January 4th, Thursday, through January 6th, Saturday),

Each session will be organized to reflect the intellectual themes of CPAL, to
help attendees focus and enjoy the day ahead.

All are welcome to attend -- gear will be provided -- but attendees are
