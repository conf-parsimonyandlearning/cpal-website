talk: "Dataless Quadratic Differentiable Combinatorial Optimization"
abstract: "Combinatorial Optimization (CO) addresses many important problems, including the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem and the Maximum Cut (MaxCut) Problem. Alongside exact and heuristic solvers, differentiable approaches have emerged, often using training data. Here, we propose a new dataless quadratic formulation for MIS and MaxCut. We characterize local minimizers and stationary points and derive conditions with respect to the solution. To tackle the non-convexity of the objectives, we propose optimizing several initializations in parallel using momentum-based gradient descent. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to exact, heuristic, sampling, and data-centric approaches. Notably, our method avoids the out-of-distribution tuning and reliance on (un)labeled data required by data-centric methods. Additionally, a key advantage of our approach is that, unlike exact and heuristic solvers, the runtime scales only with the number of nodes in the graph, not the number of edges."
