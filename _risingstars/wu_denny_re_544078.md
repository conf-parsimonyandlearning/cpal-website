talk: "Learning Single-Index Models with Neural Networks and Gradient Descent"
abstract: "Single-index models (SIMs) are characterized by a univariate link function applied to a one-dimensional projection of the input. This framework has been extensively studied in the deep learning theory literature to investigate neural networks' adaptivity to low-dimensional targets and the advantages of feature learning. In this talk, we will present recent advances in understanding the optimization dynamics of gradient-based feature learning for SIMs, drawing on analytical tools from high-dimensional statistics."
