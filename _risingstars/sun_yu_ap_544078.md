talk: "Provable Probabilistic Imaging using Score-based Generative Models"
abstract: "Inverse problems in imaging often suffer from ill-posedness, where the task of recovering an unknown signal from incomplete and noisy measurements lacks a unique solution. Posterior sampling offers a principled approach to tackle this challenge by estimating the full posterior distribution of the unknown signal, providing both reconstructions and uncertainty quantification. In this talk, I will introduce two complementary methods for provable posterior sampling in computational imaging by using score-based diffusion models. The first method is plug-and-play Monte Carlo (PnP-MC), which can be viewed as the sampling extension of the proximal gradient method; the other one is plug-and-play Diffusion Model (PnP-DM), which mimics the dynamics of alternating direction method of multipliers. Theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the two methods will be also discussed. Our results on various imaging tasks, including nonlinear black hole imaging, demonstrate the superior performance of PnP-MC/PnP-DM in image reconstruction, as well as their high-fidelity uncertainty quantification."
