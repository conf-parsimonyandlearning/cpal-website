talk: "AI Assisted Automation at Scale: Enabling Large Model Intelligence at Small Scale Devices"
abstract: "With the emergence of large foundation models (LFMs), artificial intelligence (AI) has found its use-cases in various automation tasks across multiple modalities. With this increasing surge of AI assistance, there has been increasing demand for deployment of these models at the edge including AI personal computers (AIPCs) and mobile devices. However, these deployments at scale face a fundamental challenge of deploying large models on a small computation and memory budget. Additionally, various AI assisted tasks like long context reasoning require additional memory overhead of long prefix storage. The problem further intensifies with the emergence of agents where critical thinking may often require assistance from multiple LFMs. Towards mitigating these roadblocks this talk will focus on two major classes of solutions: (1) efficient and scalable optimizations for LFMs: to reduce their latency and improve operation throughput during autoregressive inference while maintaining their down-stream task performance; and (2) enable improved capabilities via post-training optimizations: to improve a model's long context understanding beyond its training effective receptive field. In specific, we empirically demonstrate the long context understanding improvement for the Mamba state space models (SSMs) by up to orders of magnitude, that too without any training requirements of the pre-trained weights."
