talk: "Breaking the Resource Monopoly from Industries: Sustainable and Reliable LLM Serving By Recycling Outdated and Resource-Constrained GPUs"
abstract: "In recent years, Large Language Model (LLM) agents, exemplified by models like ChatGPT, and PaLM, have showcased remarkable prowess in various tasks, owing to their vast number of parameters and emergent in-context learning capabilities. To serve these gigantic models with billions of parameters, it is a trend and becomes a must to explore how to use the existing hardware, especially outdated hardware, to collectively improve environmental sustainability, efficiency, and reliability for LLM serving. A few pioneering examples include Microsoft's Project Natick, Google's TPU Pod Optimization, Alibaba's Cloud Server Repurposing, and Facebook's Network Hardware Reuse. In this talk, I will traverse my series of contributions with promising new directions, particularly emphasizing modularized LLM architecture (Part 1), in-storage sustainable computing (Part 2), and reliable serving against software and hardware attacks (Part 3)."
