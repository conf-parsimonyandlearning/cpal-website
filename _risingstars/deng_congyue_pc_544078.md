talk: "Denoising Hamiltonian Network for Physical Reasoning"
abstract: "Machine learning frameworks for physical problems are expected not only to model the data distributions, but also to understand and enforce the physical constraints that preserve the key structures of the physical systems. Many existing works address these problems by constructing physical operators in neural networks. Despite their theoretically guaranteed physical properties, these methods face two key limitations: (i) They mainly focus on local temporal relations between adjacent time steps, omitting longer-range or abstract-level physical relations; and (ii) they primarily emphasize forward simulation and overlook other physical reasoning tasks in broader scopes. To address these problems, we propose the Denoising Hamiltonian Network (DHN), a novel framework that generalizes the physical concepts in Hamiltonian mechanics with flexible neural network designs. By incorporating a denoising mechanism into the network, it also circumvents the inherent challenges of numerical integration. Moreover, we also introduce global conditioning to facilitate multi-system modeling. We demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple different physical reasoning tasks."
