talk: "The Role of Parsimonious Structures in Data for Trustworthy Machine Learning"
abstract: "This talk overviews recent theoretical results in the geometric foundations of adversarially robust machine learning. Modern ML classifiers can fail spectacularly when subject to specially crafted input-perturbations, called adversarial examples. On the other hand, we humans are quite robust for several tasks involving vision. Motivated by this disconnect, in the first part of this talk we will take a deeper dive into the question of when exactly we can avoid adversarial examples. We will see that a key geometric property of the data-distribution — concentration on small-volume subsets of the input space — characterizes whether any robust classifier exists. In particular, this suggests that natural image distributions are concentrated. In the second part of this talk, we will empirically instantiate these results for a few concentrated data-distributions, and discover that utilizing such structure in data leads to classifiers that enjoy better provable robustness guarantees in several regimes. This talk is based on work at NeurIPS ’23, ’20 and TMLR ’23."
