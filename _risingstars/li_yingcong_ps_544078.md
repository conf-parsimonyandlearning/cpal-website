abstract: "The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has drawn significant interest, but their underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. This is due to the complexity of their architectures and how their predictions depend heavily on the data. My research focuses on uncovering the fundamental reasons behind the effectiveness of LLMs. One key insight comes from analyzing attention mechanisms, and our work shows that optimized attention acts like a support vector machine, highlighting relevant elements in the input sequence while suppressing irrelevant ones."
