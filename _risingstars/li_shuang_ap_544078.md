talk: "The Future Geometric Analysis of Optimization Problems in Signal Processing and Machine Learning"
abstract: "High-dimensional data analysis and estimation appear in many signal processing and machine learning applications. The underlying low-dimensional structure in these high-dimensional data inspires us to develop optimality guarantees as well as optimization-based techniques for the fundamental problems in signal processing and machine learning. In recent years, non-convex optimization widely appears in engineering and is solved by many heuristic local algorithms, but lacks global guarantees. The recent geometric/landscape analysis provides a way to determine whether an iterative algorithm can reach global optimality. The landscape of empirical risk has been widely studied in a series of machine learning problems, including low-rank matrix factorization, matrix sensing, matrix completion, and phase retrieval. A favorable geometry guarantees that many algorithms can avoid saddle points and converge to local minima. In this presentation, I will discuss potential directions for the future geometric analysis of optimization problems in signal processing and machine learning."
