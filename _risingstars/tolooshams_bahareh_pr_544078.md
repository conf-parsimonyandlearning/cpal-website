talk: "Deep Interpretable Generative Learning for Science and Engineering"
abstract: "Discriminative and generative AI are two deep learning paradigms that revolutionized prediction and generation of high-quality images from text prompts. Nonetheless, discriminative learning is unable to generate data, and deep generative models struggle with decoding capabilities. Moreover, both approaches are data-hungry and have low interpretability. These drawbacks have posed significant barriers to the adoption of deep learning in applications where a) acquiring supervised data is expensive or infeasible, and b) goals extend beyond data fitting to attain scientific insights. Furthermore, deep learning applications are fairly unexplored in fields with rich mathematical and optimization frameworks such as inverse problems, or those in which interpretability matters. This talk discusses the theory and applications of deep learning in data-limited or unsupervised inverse problems. These include applications in radar sensing, Poisson image denoising, and computational neuroscience."
