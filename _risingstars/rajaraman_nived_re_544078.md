talk: "New data-centric frameworks for sequential-decision making"
abstract: "As machine learning systems grow increasingly general-purpose and data-centric, there is a pressing need to develop approaches which mitigate the significant cost of collecting high-quality data. This challenge is exacerbated when agents are deployed in settings involving settings involving sequential decision making. In such changing environments, unseen situations are encountered frequently and undesirable behavior can be catastrophic. For problems involving sequential decision making, a hybrid pipeline (1. pre-training a base policy from offline datasets, which is then 2. fine-tuned by online exploration) has emerged as one of the most effective ways to train performant agents. But how do we carry out pre-training and fine-tuning efficiently and robustly, when access to high-quality data forms one of the major bottlenecks? In this talk, I will discuss new approaches for this problem, which build upon insights derived from principled mathematical frameworks. I will present, (i) [Pre-training] A statistical framework for Imitation Learning, resulting in provably optimal algorithms which have small data footprints in practice. (ii) [Fine-tuning] A study of how verifier-based approaches (such as RL) appear to scale more favorably than verifier-free approaches with fixed data budgets I will conclude with a discussion of future research directions and the longer-term goal of exploring the interplay of RL and modern approaches to sequence-modeling."
