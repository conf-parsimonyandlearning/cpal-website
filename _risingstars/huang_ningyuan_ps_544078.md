talk: "Approximately Equivariant Graph Networks"
abstract: "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly described as being permutation equivariant with respect to node relabeling in the graph. This symmetry of GNNs is often compared to the translation equivariance of Euclidean convolution neural networks (CNNs). However, these two symmetries are fundamentally different: The translation equivariance of CNNs corresponds to active symmetries, whereas the permutation equivariance of GNNs corresponds to passive symmetries. In this talk, we focus on the active symmetries of GNNs, by considering a learning setting where signals are supported on a fixed graph. In this case, the natural symmetries of GNNs are the automorphisms of the graph. Since real-world graphs tend to be asymmetric, we relax the notion of symmetries by formalizing approximate symmetries via graph coarsening. We propose approximately equivariant graph networks to implement these symmetries and investigate the symmetry model selection problem. We theoretically and empirically show a bias-variance tradeoff between the loss in expressivity and the gain in the regularity of the learned estimator, depending on the chosen symmetry group."
