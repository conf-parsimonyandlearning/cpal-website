talk: "Understanding Hierarchical Representations in Deep Networks via Intermediate Features"
abstract: "Over the past decade, deep learning has proven to be a highly effective method for learning meaningful features from raw data. This work attempts to unveil the mystery of hierarchical feature learning in deep networks. Specifically, in the context of multi-class classification problems, we explore how deep networks transform input data by investigating the output (i.e., features) of each layer after training. Towards this goal, we first define metrics for within-class compression and between-class discrimination of intermediate features, respectively. Through an analysis of these two metrics, we show that the evolution of features follows a simple and quantitative law from shallow to deep layers: Each layer of linear networks progressively compresses within-class features at a linear rate and discriminates between-class features at a sublinear rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative characterization of feature evolution in hierarchical representations of deep networks. Moreover, our extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings numerically."
