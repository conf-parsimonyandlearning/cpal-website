talk: "Emergent properties of heuristics in machine learning"
abstract: "Successful methods in modern machine learning practice are built on solid intuition and theoretical insight by their designers, but are often ultimately heuristic and exhibit unintended emergent behaviors. Sometimes these emergent behaviors are detrimental, but surprisingly, many provide unexpected desirable benefits. By theoretically characterizing these emergent behaviors, we can develop a more robust methods development process, where more and more of these desirable behaviors can be included by design and leveraged in powerful ways. I will discuss several examples of heuristics and emergent behavior: subsampling and sketching in linear regression and their equivalence to ridge regularization; empirical risk minimization and the universality of relative performances under distribution shifts; and adaptivity in dropout and feature learning models which are equivalent to parsimony-promoting sparse or low-rank regularization."
