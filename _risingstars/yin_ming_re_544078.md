talk: "On the role of reinforcement learning in the era of generative AI"
abstract: "The rise of generative AI has transformed the landscape of artificial intelligence, enabling unprecedented capabilities in creative problem-solving, content generation, and novel scientific discovery. However, as these models continue to scale, challenges related to alignment, safety, and decision-making in dynamic, real-world environments become increasingly prominent. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful framework to address these challenges by enabling agents to learn from feedback, optimize long-term outcomes, and adapt to complex scenarios. This talk explores the intersection of reinforcement learning and generative AI, highlighting how RL can enhance generative models in areas such as fine-tuning for user preferences, faster inference, and safe deployment. We also discuss the evaluation front for the current generative AI."
