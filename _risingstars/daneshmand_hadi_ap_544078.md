abstract: "Understanding the mechanisms of deep learning models with billions of parameters is a fundamental challenge in AI research. Recent findings reveal that feature extraction in these models progresses incrementally, step-by-step, across network layers. We will review these experimental observations and present theoretical studies that explain the incremental process. We show how this process enables models to implement iterative algorithms capable of solving several problems, including linear regression, optimal transport, and policy evaluation for reinforcement learning, with theoretical guarantees. This computational view provides insights into effective practices like prompt engineering for language models. These findings are steps towards learning from data to implement algorithms, a lasting quest in neural computing research."
